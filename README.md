# Showcase
Showcase portfolio website

Created during the course of roughly a month using Vite and React.
The site is a simple showcase of my personal skills and experience.

The React is written in Typescript, since I enjoy strong typing when writing code and thus prefer TS over JS.

The animations and graphical effects are mainly created using keyframes in pure CSS.
I also opted to mainly use module CSS files for my styling instead of Styled-Components or other forms of styling.
This due to the simplicity and ease of overview that the modules give me.
All of my JSX components are also written in function form, instead of class form, following newer React trends. 

The site achieves responsiveness using mainly traditional media queries and clamp/max CSS properties.

The repo is public and hosted on my Github: https://github.com/VedranIsak/Showcase
